We'll say a number is special if it is a multiple of 11 or if it is one more than a multiple of 11. 
Print “SPECIAL” if the given non-negative number is special. Use the % "mod" operator. 

        1) Take as the user input from the user.
        2) if the number get that remainder is equality to zero or one.
        3) Then,it will print as "special".
        4) if that condition is false means it will print as "not special".
